<h2>My ideal job in IT.</h2>
<p>I am currently interested in studying to become an IT or ICT Manager. As an example, the Surf Live Saving Australia organisation are currently looking<br>
for an ICT manager as advertised on the website Seek: <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50545985?type=standard#searchRequestToken=36c06939-becb-46cc-8d7b-11aa9b4f513e" target="_blank"> https://www.seek.com.au/.</a>
If the job posting is no longer listed, please see the following image<br>
for reference: <a href="idealjobcapture.png" target="_blank">'My Ideal Job'.</a> I believe an IT or ICT manager is an individual who leads a team of dedicated IT staff in developing and maintaining<br>
various systems and technologies for a business or company; an ICT manager would be responsible for communicating and liaising with other departments<br>
within the organisation, and to discuss and present new ideas and changes that may benefit the company. They would also be responsible for maintaining<br>
the well-being of the IT team, ensuring they remain capable and productive in their work. This role appeals to me because I am confident in my existing<br>
knowledge and pride myself on being able to effectively communicate with customers, staff members, vendors and manufacturers to provide solutions; I<br>
also believe I have gained and can demonstrate valuable skills in conflict resolution and team management, making this position a natural extension of<br>
my current responsibilities.</p>
<p>I believe an IT or ICT manager will need to have an extensive knowledge of IT systems and the way they interact; the ability to successfully lead and<br>
manage a team of IT staff; effectively communicate with individuals, teams or departments within a business or company; and ensure that their IT team and<br>
relevant systems or technologies operate within the organisationâ€™s mission statement or objectives. They will need to be a strong communicator and be able<br>
to anticipate and meet needs for their team. Previous work experience as part of an IT team or team manager would be a huge benefit for a potential candidate,<br>
as well as experience with common application software.</p>
<p>I believe that many of the skills required to become and IT or ICT manager can be obtained by studying a Bachelor of Information Technology or similar<br>
degree, with electing to complete a Minor Stream in Management; completing an additional Graduate Diploma of Management would grant further skills and<br>
resources in team management and be highly beneficial when applying for similar positions. I believe
obtaining successful employment as part of an IT team<br>
would demonstrate to a potential employer that you can successfully operate as an individual and as part of a team.</p>
