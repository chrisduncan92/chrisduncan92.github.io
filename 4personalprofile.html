<h2>My personal profile.</h2>
<p>To further understand and develop my learning skills and ability to work in a team, I have undertaken an online Myers-Briggs personality test, a learning<br>
style test, and a leadership style test.</p>
<p>The results of each of the tests, and my interpretations of what they mean to me, are as follows:</p>
<h3> * 16Personalities test - <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target="_blank">https://www.16personalities.com/</a> * </h3>
<p>This personality test indicates that I am an ‘Advocate’ personality: Advocates see great cause in helping others achieve goals and feel fulfilled if<br>
they are successful, working with determination and passion. The test suggests that Advocates approach tasks and challenges with creativity and imagination;<br>
while they can be strong-willed and act decisively, Advocates are sensitive to other’s needs and are determined to create a sense of balance through their<br>
actions. Advocates strive for their work to be altruistic in purpose, knowing that they are helping others & by connecting with people.</p>
<p>I believe an Advocate personality is a huge benefit to a team or group in approaching challenges or ideas in a unique, creative way; their determination<br>
and passion will ensure they work effectively at individual tasks and contribute to projects. Advocates will be sensitive and respectful towards group members,<br>
helping facilitate a constructive and harmonious environment: through their empathy, Advocates will offer support and assistance to other group members who<br>
are struggling or facing individual problems. Because Advocates are decisive and strong-willed, this may cause disagreements between group members:<br>
Advocates will need to ensure they clearly communicate personal ideas and thoughts with the group, especially when their work may affect other members.</p>
<p>I believe this Advocate personality type does accurately describe my approach to tasks or challenges in a personal and professional setting, as well as<br>
my professional goal of always providing the right solution to the customer. I believe my work and the outcomes I achieve are amplified by my empathetic<br>
and sensitive approach to tasks, challenges, and communication; I am interested to discover new methods or techniques to solve problems and always ready to<br>
assist my work colleagues in any way possible. I am eager to further develop the way I approach and work through challenges and look forward to constructing<br>
a successful project with my group.</p>
<h3> * EMTRAIN Learning styles quiz - <a href="http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/ " target="_blank">http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/</a> *</h3>
<p>This learning style quiz suggests that I primarily learn in the ‘Pragmatist’ style, where learning is most effective using practical examples, case studies and<br>
discussions. Pragmatist learners need to be able to visualise how to apply learning to real world problems; they are comfortable with experimenting and trying<br>
out new ideas or techniques to see if they are successful. Pragmatist learners may feel more comfortable in active attempts to apply learning rather than lengthy discussions.</p>
<p>In a group or team environment, a Pragmatist learner will likely be ready to jump into tasks or challenges, especially if they have had previous experience<br>
with the work. They may struggle with long discussions about projects with other team members and may require tactile resources to help them better understand<br>
challenges or tasks. This can easily be addressed by visually breaking down ideas and challenges in a clear manner, such as by creating a timeline or list of<br>
tasks to complete, and by establishing effective communication to address any questions or concerns during project work.</p>
<p>Through the course of my professional career, I have found that I can learn more effectively in a hands-on approach to tasks or problems, which I believe fits<br>
within the Pragmatist learning style. I find the use of visual aids or instructions extremely beneficial in understanding issues or developing a new skill or technique.</p>
<h3> * USC Price Leadership Style Assessment - <a href="https://eml.usc.edu/leadership-style-quiz" target="_blank">https://eml.usc.edu/leadership-style-quiz</a> * </h3>
<p>This assessment determined that I most suit the ‘Postmodern’ leadership style, which is an altruistic style in the way that leaders can bring joy to others by<br>
their role. Postmodern leaders can find pleasure and fulfillment in being able to influence society in a positive way; they can help realise the human potential<br>
of their team members or those they affect through their work. Through their role and work as a leader, they can help people realise how empowering creating a<br>
positive future can be.</p>
<p>A Postmodern leader would be instrumental in creating an open, constructive and upbeat team environment, encouraging team members to apply their ideas, skills<br>
and knowledge to create positive change in the world. With a heavy focus on the wellbeing of their team members, Postmodern leaders will strive to create a safe<br>
working environment and will be extremely respectful and considerate in their approach to all aspects of a project. They will help develop a welcoming and safe<br>
work culture, where team members feel comfortable in discussing issues or problems and having them resolved successfully. A positive work ethic and environment<br>
will help produce high standards of work and personal relationships.</p>
<p>I believe the Postmodern leadership style does match aspects of my personality and also coincides with the personality test I have undertaken: Postmodern leaders<br>
require a high degree of empathy and sensitivity in order to establish and develop personal connections and effectively recognise and address issues and concerns.<br>
I personally find great joy and fulfillment in helping others, both inside of outside of work, or knowing that knowledge or a skill I passed on to someone has<br>
helped them achieve a goal or complete a task of their own.</p>
