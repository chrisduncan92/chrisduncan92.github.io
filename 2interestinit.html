<h2 style="color:#ff1a1a;">My interest in IT.</h2>
<p style="font-size:18px;">I have always had a keen interest in learning and understanding how IT products work and function together; how the technology can benefit individuals,<br>
groups and cultures; and theorising the implications that new developments or technologies in the space have for our future. I am particularly fascinated<br>
by the rise of ‘Deepfake’ technology, which refers to an existing video or image that has been manipulated by an AI program to show events or an individual<br>
saying something that never actually occurred. I believe this technology has profound implications for the education and mass media sectors and provides a real<br>
threat to a world already struggling to separate reliable and unreliable media.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">My interest in IT predominately comes from my love of gaming and being able to build or modify desktop PCs, the beginnings of which I happily attribute to<br>
my father. For as long as I can remember, Dad always had a desktop PC or two in the house: I can recall an old PC, running Windows 95 and with a giant CRT <br>
monitor, that Dad loaded multiple games on and would teach us how to play. Over the years this passion grew and expanded: I bought my first notebook PC while<br>
in high school to play ‘Left 4 Dead 2’, which I still play to this day, and several years after I built my first gaming desktop with a little help from Dad.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">While I studied various IT subjects throughout high school and did work experience with the IT department of the Catholic Education Office Wollongong,<br> 
most of my experience in IT is self-taught or comes from my current employment. My employment requires me to be knowledgeable and adept at determining and<br>
troubleshooting problems with IT products or systems, as well as being able configure or tailor these aspects to suit customer’s needs. This can involve:<br>
physically disassembling products to address or resolve hardware faults; having in-depth knowledge of multiple PC and mobile device operating systems; being<br>
familiar with command line interfaces; liaising with customers, vendors, service agents and manufacturers; providing basic technical support over the phone or<br>
by email; and dealing with different departments and teams within the store to provide a solution.</p>
<h2 style="color:#ff1a1a;">Why did you choose to study with RMIT? What do you expect to learn through your studies?</h2>
<p style="font-size:18px;">I chose to study with RMIT, through Open Universities Australia, because they offered online study for a course I was interested in, allowing me to work<br>
around my full-time employment schedule. I have so far had an excellent experience with the RMIT teaching staff and the online study experience.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">During my studies, I am expecting to build upon and expand my existing knowledge in the consumer & retail IT sector; I am looking forward to gaining<br>
valuable skills in programming and networking, which I do not have a lot of experience in, and to obtain a deeper understanding of how other IT systems<br>
function and operate. I would also like to increase my critical thinking abilities, discover new formats and methods to present information & data, and to<br>
broaden my capacity to work as an individual and within a group.</p>
