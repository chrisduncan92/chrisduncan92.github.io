<h2 style="color:#ff1a1a;">My Project Idea!</h2>
<p style="font-size:18px;">In today’s digital age it has never been more important to practice good password hygiene, which refers to safely using individual,complex passwords for online accounts.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">But how realistic is this practice when, for example, Australian internet users have an average of 6.7 social media accounts alone? (Kemp 2020, slide 42.)</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">A key tool for developing and maintaining good password hygiene is by using a password manager application, which allows users to save<br>
and manage passwords or login information for their online accounts. Many password managers, however, can appear daunting to a new or inexperienced user and prove<br>
difficult to use, often turning users away from the tool entirely.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">My project idea will be to develop a password manager that is heavily focused on ease of use and designed in a simple, clear layout that allows friendly and<br>
intuitive navigation. This project will be targeted at consumers who have no experience with a password manager or have had a negative experience with the tool<br>
previously. The password manager will help users familiarise themselves with safe password hygiene by providing tips or information during use, such as not reusing<br>
passwords and creating unique, secure passwords for their accounts, which will in turn reinforce the benefits of using a password manager.</p>
<h3 style="color:#ff1a1a;"> * Motivation * </h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">In addition to the ever-increasing number of online accounts the average internet user has, an Online Security Survey published by Google (2019) discovered<br>
that a staggering 65% of adults in the U.S. between the ages of 16-50+ reused the same password for multiple OR all accounts. Two years prior, Verizon’s<br>
annual Data Breach Investigations Report (2017, p. 5) determined that a massive 81% of hacking-related breaches investigated ‘leveraged either stolen and/or weak passwords’.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">From my personal experience in the retail IT sector, the majority of consumers over the age of 50 I interact with are unable to remember their account passwords,<br>
requiring these passwords to be reset; if they are able remember a password or have it written down, I further discover that they are reusing the same, often simple<br>
or unsafe, password for multiple accounts. These consumers complain about the difficulty they experience in having to remember so many different account passwords.<br>
as well as regularly having to reset forgotten passwords, but typically have never used or are unfamiliar with a password manager tool.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">I believe that developing a password manager that is user friendly and easily navigable will help consumers learn and practice good password hygiene, and to<br>
develop a better understanding of safety & security in the digital world.</p>
<h3 style="color:#ff1a1a;"> * Description * </h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">The password manager will be a downloadable application or program that could be designed to run on major software platforms such as Windows, macOS, Android<br>
and iOS. The application will allow users to securely save and access any number of login credentials, from email passwords to online banking logins, by using a single<br>
master access code. Saved credentials or items will be displayed in a visually appealing and familiar journal-style format, including shortcuts to perform key<br>
functions or quickly search for a specific credential, to ensure users do not get lost or confused when using the application. The ability to customise the colour<br>
theme of the application, such as changing the main background colour from white to black or text colour from black to blue, will also provide a further degree<br>
of familiarity or comfort to the user.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">When opened, the application will prompt the user to create a master access code in the form of a password, passphrase or PIN code; this access code could also<br>
be supplemented by a biometric login method, such as fingerprint or facial recognition functions found in modern smartphones, for simpler and more secure access.<br>
As the master access code will be used to access their collection of credentials, referred to as a 'vault', it is the most crucial component of the application:<br>
the user will be prompted to create a unique, memorable and secure code and be reminded not to record this code anywhere.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">After accessing their vault, users can simply tap a create or add button in the bottom-right corner to add their first credential: in the following create screen,<br>
they will be asked to record a name for the credential (e.g. Facebook, Google) and to create and confirm a password. When creating a password, helpful suggestions<br>
or hints on creating secure passwords will be provided (e.g. passwords greater than 8 characters in length; mix of letters, numbers and symbols) as well as an option<br>
to have a password randomly created via a built-in secure password generator. Users would then also have the option to add notes to this login, such as applicable<br>
recovery information for the credential or answers to security questions.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">Users will view their vault as a list of items in a simple notebook or journal-style design: their credentials will be listed alphabetically by name, allowing<br>
the user to scroll up & down to view items. Adding small tabs along the right-edge of the page, with shortcuts to jump to a range of credentials (e.g. accounts<br>
named with characters 1-9, A-M and N-Z) will allow users to quickly navigate between saved credentials. Adding a search button along the top edge of the window<br>
to allow users to search for a specific credential will further increase the ease of use and access.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">Simply tapping a credential will display the account, password and any notes saved; while the passwords initially appear as asterisks or dots for privacy, the<br>
user can tap a show/hide button to view the password or  a copy button to temporarily save the password to the device’s clipboard memory.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">Upon exit or close, the password manager will lock the vault for security and require the master access code to be input when opened again.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">The credentials in the user’s vault will be securely encrypted by the device, and can only be decrypted and accessed by entering the master access code; if<br>
this master access code is forgotten, there is no way to access the encrypted vault data and the application will securely erase the vault and data contained within.<br>
This is primarily done for security reasons, as the ability to reset a master password could expose a potential vulnerability or weakness in the application.</p>
<h3 style="color:#ff1a1a;"> * Tools and Technologies * </h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">As the password manager application will be installed and run on the user’s preferred device and operating system, no dedicated hardware or other equipment will be required<br>
to use the application.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">The password manager would first be developed as an application for the Android mobile-based operating system, which can be done freely through the Android<br>
Studio tool: <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/studio/.</a> Android Studio will allow the application to integrate various hardware components of the user’s device, such<br>
as the fingerprint reader for an alternate access method.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">The application will need to include various security software components to ensure the user’s data is safely stored. A modern cryptography standard such as<br>
AES-CBC would be used to encrypt the user’s vault data, requiring the correct master access code for decryption. Existing open source cryptographic code libraries,<br>
such as ‘Web Crypto’ - <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/" target="_blank">https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/</a> - or ‘Forge’ - <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge" target="_blank">https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge</a> - would be used as a basis to develop the data encryption<br>
method. It would also be beneficial to examine existing open source password managers, such as the free application Bitwarden - <a href="https://bitwarden.com/" target="_blank">https://bitwarden.com/</a>, source code<br>
available at <a href="https://github.com/bitwarden" target="_blank">https://github.com/bitwarden</a> - to gain a better understanding of developing a secure password manager.</p>
<h3 style="color:#ff1a1a;"> * Skills Required * </h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">To begin developing this application for the Android operating system, it will be necessary to obtain an in-depth knowledge of and experience with Java and Kotlin<br>
programming languages; a fundamental understanding of other languages (e.g. JavaScript, C#, HTML) would also be beneficial when researching code libraries. A basic<br>
understanding of these programming languages can be learnt online but completing a programming skills course or qualification - such as a Bachelor of Computer Science<br>
through RMIT University - would provide an in-depth knowledge of and ability to successfully apply these languages.</p>
<h3 style="color:#ff1a1a;"> * Outcome * </h3>
<p style="font-size:18px;">If this project is successful, I believe this password manager will greatly increase the user’s online safety and help to reduce the chance of experiencing an<br>
online hack; the application will also eliminate the stress of managing passwords and help cultivate a better online experience for the user. By using this password<br>
manager, the user will learn the importance of good password hygiene and account management which will only become more relevant in the future as the digital world<br>
continues to expand. By reducing the number of weak or reused passwords, especially if applied to users within a business, this password manager may<br>
also help reduce large-scale data breaches and some of the financial loss that can be contributed to online hacks or breaches.</p>
